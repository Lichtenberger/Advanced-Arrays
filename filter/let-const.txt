Problem #1
var PI = 3.14;
PI = 42; // stop me from doing this!

so for the you would simply change the var to const, let could be used but PI is always 3.14 and

const PI = 3.14

Problem #2
/* Write an ES2015 Version */
const sky = blue;
let today = cloudy;

1. What is the difference between var and let?
let is block scope and cannot be redeclared, while var is not block scope and does not care if redeclared
2. What is the difference between var and const
const is block scope and cannot be redeclared
3. What is the difference between let and const?
const cannot be redeclared
4. What is hoisting?
hoisting is using declared variables outside the block
